# Noor_LLM

Welcome to the Noor_LLM Projects repository! This repository will host various projects and experiments related to Language Model (LLM) development and applications. Stay tuned for updates and new projects in the field of Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence.

## Projects

1. **Leveraging BERT for Ranked Predictions: An Entry-Level Guide for LLM Science Exam**
   - This project focuses on utilizing the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for ranked predictions in the context of a science exam. It provides a beginner-friendly guide to understanding how BERT can be applied to enhance the accuracy of predictions and rankings in natural language processing tasks. The project includes detailed steps, code examples, and explanations to help newcomers get started with BERT and ranked predictions.

2. **Text Classification with Transformers**
   - This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained transformer model for text classification using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The example uses the BERT model to classify text from the IMDb dataset. It provides a foundation for understanding text classification tasks and experimenting with different transformer models and datasets.
   - **Key Features:**
     - Fine-tunes a BERT model on a subset of the IMDb dataset.
     - Includes scripts for training and evaluation.
     - Easily extensible for other datasets and transformer models.
